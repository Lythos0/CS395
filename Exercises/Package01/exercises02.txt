1. 

(a) f:A -> D that is a surjection, meaning every element in D needs to be mapped to at least once.
A has 5 elements while D has 3.
This is possible because |A| > |D|

(b) g: B -> C that is an injection, meaning all elements in B map to different elements in C.
B has 5 elements while C has 6.
This is possible because |C| is greater than or equal to |B|

(c) h: C -> D that is not a surjection because some elements of D is not mapped to.
C has 6 elements and D has 3.

(d) i: A -> B that is a bijection because both sets have the same numbers of elements.
|A| = 5, |B| = 5.


(e) j: C -> B that is a bijection
|C| = 6, |B| = 5, different sizes.
This is impossible to be a bijection.


2.
a) Domain = all possible inputs
f's domain: {2,3,5,7} (just the numbers in A)
g's domain: all combinations of A and B: {(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3)}

b) Codomain = where outputs can go
Both: {0,1,2,3} (the set B)

c) Range = actual outputs we get
f's range: {0,2,3} (calculated from f(x) = (3x+1) mod 4)
g's range: {0,1,2,3} (g produces all possible outputs)

d) f(x) values:
f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(5)=0, f(7)=2

e) g(x,y) for specific values:
g(5,2)=3, g(5,3)=3, g(7,2)=3, g(7,3)=1

3. 
Two groups:
Self-inverse permutations: identity, swaps like (1 2), and pairs of swaps like (1 2)(3 4)
Not self-inverse: 3-cycles like (1 2 3), 4-cycles like (1 2 3 4)

4. 
a) Reflexive & symmetric but not transitive:
All self-pairs + (1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2)

Reflexive: every number relates to itself
Symmetric: if (1,2) then (2,1)
Not transitive: (1,2) and (2,3) but no (1,3)

b) Reflexive & transitive but not symmetric:
All self-pairs + (1,2)

Reflexive: Yes
Transitive: only one extra pair, no chain
Not symmetric: (1,2) but no (2,1)

c) Symmetric & transitive but not reflexive:
Empty relation {}
Symmetric: no pairs to check
Transitive: no pairs to check
Not reflexive: no self-pairs

d) Equivalence relation:
All self-pairs only {(1,1),(2,2),...,(10,10)}
Reflexive, symmetric, transitive

e) Partial ordering:
All self-pairs only
Reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive

5. 
a) Make reflexive: Add missing self-pairs
Add (b,b), (c,c), (d,d)

b) Make symmetric: Add reverse of each pair
Add (b,a), (d,b), (c,d)

c) Make transitive: Add pairs to complete chains
(a,b) + (b,d) → add (a,d)
(b,d) + (d,c) → add (b,c)
(a,d) + (d,c) → add (a,c)
