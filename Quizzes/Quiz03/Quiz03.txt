1. I would substitute n for 1 and that would give me the result of n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 to be equal to 6/6 which is the same as 1 on the right hand side. And on the left hand side we get, i^2 = 1^2 which is 1.
2. Let's assume that this works for any number "k" where k is greater or equal to 1, we'd just have the same equation replaced with k.
3. We would have the left side being i^2 + (k+1)^2 and the right side ending up as (K+1)(K+2)(2k+3)/6 which shows it to be true for all positive integers of n.
