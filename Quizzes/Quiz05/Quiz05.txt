1. Using 011 as an example. 011 starts as QEE
With an input of 0 it becomes QOE (odd 0s, even 1s)
Then with a 1 it becomes QOO (odd 0s odd 1s)
With another 1 it becomes QOE (odd 0s, even 1s)
QOE is not QEO therefore it is not what we want. 


2. With 101 we begin in QEE 
Input 1 gives us QEO
Input 0 gives us QOO
Input 1 gives us QOE

QOE is not QEO so we reject this string



3. With 111 we begin in QEE
Input 1 gives us QEO
Input 1 gives us QEE
Input 1 gives us QEO

QEO = QEO which matches what we're looking for.
